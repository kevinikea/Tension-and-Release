Buzzer Beater.  Hail Mary.  A kick through the uprights. The golden goal. The walk off.
These are the areas of tension and release
There is a moment and there is a time for every player to be the guy in their career
They don’t know what’s about to happen
They don’t know who’s watching
They don’t know where this play is going
They don’t know when it will happen
They don’t know how it will happen
They don’t know that this moment will change their life
All they do know is that they know something is about to happen



Legends. Forever enshrined in these moments that they created
An instant of clarity and a dip into self-actualization
 But they live in that moment
When it went down
Who it went down with
Where it all went down
How it went down
What even went down
They will never fully know the circumstances of what they have just done
They have given a moment to the people who watch
They have given a city hope
They have given a moment of tension and release
